Perfect — now you're working like a **pro UX debugger**. Let's design a few **realistic interaction flows** to test the full app experience, breaking it down into **testable steps**, including **likely failure points** and **what should be confirmed**.

---

## 🧪 **FLOW 1: Full Flow from File Scan → Run AI on File**

### 🧩 Goal:
> I want to scan a folder, see a list of `.py`/`.ipynb` files, and run AI on one.

| 🔢 Step | Action | 🧪 What to Check | ⚠️ Likely Failure |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Visit page | Folder auto-scans? | `scannedFiles` empty or undefined |
| 2 | File list renders | Are file names shown? | Broken API, wrong data shape |
| 3 | Click "Run" next to a file | Button triggers request? | No console log / no request |
| 4 | API receives full path | POST includes `filepath` | `text` used instead of `filepath` |
| 5 | AI response shown | Output appears below | No output or bad parsing |
| 6 | New run | Output updates with new file | Old result remains or UI stuck |

---

## 🧪 **FLOW 2: Change Flow Type from Dropdown**

### 🧩 Goal:
> I want to switch from “Code Review” to another flow and see new schema reflected.

| 🔢 Step | Action | 🧪 What to Check | ⚠️ Likely Failure |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Change dropdown to "Architecture Inference" | Schema is fetched | `/flow/{name}/schema` not hit |
| 2 | Form updates | Inputs change dynamically | Hardcoded PromptForm |
| 3 | Run with new flow | Schema used properly | Wrong schema sent to OpenAI |
| 4 | Output matches new flow | Output format aligns | Output shows old flow content |

---

## 🧪 **FLOW 3: Browse Directory from Explorer**

### 🧩 Goal:
> I want to browse folders manually and click a file to run it.

| 🔢 Step | Action | 🧪 What to Check | ⚠️ Likely Failure |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Render `LocalFileExplorer` | Shows current folder | State bug / path undefined |
| 2 | Click subfolder | Updates files view | Doesn’t load subdir contents |
| 3 | Click ".." or goUp | Goes to parent folder | `goUp` undefined or wrong path |
| 4 | Click file "Run" | Sends correct path | Path malformed / double slashes |
| 5 | Output appears | Same behavior as Flow 1 | Conflicts with scannedFiles |

---

## 🧪 **FLOW 4: Run Flow with Custom Code (Textarea)**

### 🧩 Goal:
> Paste custom code into a box and get a review.

| 🔢 Step | Action | 🧪 What to Check | ⚠️ Likely Failure |
|--------|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Paste code | Textarea captures text | Controlled input broken |
| 2 | Click Run | Sends request | Wrong API endpoint |
| 3 | Output | Parsed response shown | Nothing returned, no schema |
| 4 | Run again | Overwrites last output | Old result stays |

---

## 🧪 **FLOW 5: Error Handling / Empty States**

| Case | Trigger | Should Happen | Check |
|------|---------|----------------|-------|
| ❌ Invalid folder path | Scan `/made/up/path` | Show error toast or message | 404 / no feedback |
| ❌ No matching files | `.jpg` only | Show empty message | Blank UI |
| ❌ File without text | Empty notebook | Skip or show fallback | Crash |
| ❌ OpenAI error | Fake API key | Show "could not connect" | Silent failure |
| ❌ Schema missing | Flow misconfigured | Show “schema not found” | Crashes |

---

## ✅ Bonus: Build a Manual Checklist

Use this each time you change the app:

```
[ ] Folder scan works
[ ] Files render
[ ] Run on file triggers correct API
[ ] Flow dropdown updates schema
[ ] Prompt form reflects schema fields
[ ] Output renders formatted
[ ] Explorer navigates folders
[ ] Run on pasted code works
[ ] No console errors
```

Would you like me to generate **test data**, a fake schema, or a stub file tree for deeper testing? Or auto-create this as a Markdown `.md` checklist file?
